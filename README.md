This repository demonstrates an unexpected behavior when comparing numeric strings in MongoDB using the `$toDouble` operator within a `$expr` query. The issue occurs when strings that are not in standard numeric format are compared resulting in unexpected results.  The solution shows how to reliably handle diverse numeric string formats during comparison.
